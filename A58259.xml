            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS Humbly offered in Justification of the Action, of letting a Room in <hi>London</hi>-House unto certain peaceable Christians, called ANABAPTISTS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Doubt not but very many will bear me witness, how much and often I appeared and gave my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion (some years together by-past) for <hi>bearing</hi> and <hi>forbearing</hi> amongst Christians; <hi>and as</hi> for an Endeavor by <hi>all means</hi> to <hi>attain</hi> and <hi>maintain</hi> a holy <hi>Æ²nion</hi> and <hi>Communion in Spirit,</hi> and Christian Practise, <hi>(wherein how much rather would I be imployed then in any thing of more dividing tendency:)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>So also</hi> in order <hi>unto,</hi> and as a small <hi>branch of</hi> the <hi>former,</hi> to give toleration (if I shall so call it) <hi>viz. Common priviledg,</hi> room and countenance <hi>unto all Christians</hi> and <hi>Societies</hi> that are of <hi>peaceable deportment,</hi> and that hold the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>true</hi> Christian Religion, <hi>(and practise accordingly,) although erroneous in many things,</hi> but not for any countenance, no <hi>nor sufferance</hi> of <hi>error,</hi> only for <hi>necessity, lest we pluck up the good corn also,</hi> Mat. 13.</p>
            <p>But my <hi>brethren</hi> of <hi>different opinions,</hi> then still urged me for a Rule, <hi>how far that toleration</hi> should <hi>extend;</hi> for <hi>said they,</hi> generals may be pretended to extend <hi>exceedingly too far:</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I thought not of making <hi>this</hi> the <hi>particular Case,</hi> when first it came in question, <hi>yet</hi> indeed seeing I know not that <hi>that</hi> question hath yet been determined <hi>amongst us,</hi> I apprehending my self <hi>bound</hi> both by <hi>Covenant,</hi> as by <hi>Baptism</hi> and <hi>Christian Profession;</hi> to seek and endeavor after <hi>Æ²nion with Brethren, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 span">

                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:41090:2"/>Faith;</hi> seeing it <hi>now</hi> providentially is in question, <hi>I desire</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it my Christian duty) to bring it to <hi>such a Result</hi> as may at least satisfie my self in my <hi>own spirit,</hi> if not also the spirits of others, in the point.</p>
            <p>And conceivign this a very fit <hi>season</hi> and <hi>opportunity</hi> for the obtaining thereof; I <hi>humbly conceive</hi> I ought not to imbrace that <hi>(otherwise good)</hi> motion, which was made by, <hi>I suppose,</hi> a Lover of <hi>Peace,</hi> viz. <hi>to wave the question, and convert the Room,</hi> in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, <hi>to other use,</hi> in accommodation with the spirits of <hi>brethren that take offence;</hi> which I suppose I shall make haste <hi>to do</hi> (to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd the offence of the weak) <hi>if it shall be desired;</hi> when once the <hi>question</hi> is so <hi>stated</hi> and <hi>determined,</hi> That <hi>Gods precious Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Freedom</hi> of <hi>Christian Brethren,</hi> and <hi>Christian Practise,</hi> may not suffer thereby.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>REASONS humbly offered, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>UPon the matter in question; <hi>Whether I</hi> (being admitted an Elder into the first Classis, usually meeting at the Black-Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>London) did not sin, and come under just reproof, in letting of a Room in London-House;</hi> which stood voyd, unimproved, and <hi>which I had the letting of, although for another Interest,</hi> and not in the least for my self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which Room,</hi> at the request, and for the accommodation of Mr <hi>Jesse,</hi> Mr <hi>Kissin,</hi> and others, whom I conceive to be truly godly, (but dissenting in the point of baptizing of Infants, and I suppose in the manner of Church-Government, <hi>and it may be in some others) I did let to Mr Tomlins for two moneths,</hi> with this condition, That it should be employed to no use but what was good and laudable, and without any annoyance; and if in the proof I should find any just exception, I might demand it at the two moneths end, or at any time give warning, and within such a time it should be surrendred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Æ²pon the question, Whether or no I did not sin in this action,</hi> in that I did then suppose that the persons abovesaid would there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise Religion, and might in reason conceive, and could not but think, That <hi>that</hi> principle that engaged them to dissent, would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them, as they conceived occasion required, to preach their said dissenting Points</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or whether I had, or have</hi>

                     <desc>ãâ¦ã</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:41090:2"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I humbly desire to <hi>premise</hi> as followeth:</p>
               <p>First, That the question was not (in our last debate) <hi>Whether weak brethren of the way that I own (viz.</hi> Consociation and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of Churches) <hi>do not take offence at what I have done; And what I ought now to do in reference thereunto,</hi> (though such a motion indeed at last was made, <hi>viz.</hi> to lay aside the question, and to put them out upon that account,) <hi>which I conceive I may not, until the point in question is cleared,</hi> lest I therein do against the Truth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Nor the question debated, or to be debated, was not, <hi>Whether</hi> they <hi>have there driven a design rather to advance those</hi> particular Points <hi>wherein they differ from us,</hi> then to advance the propagation of the Gospel unto all; and in special unto <hi>such</hi> who through weakness and prejudice (as I conceive, like that which was in those of the Circumcision towards those of the uncircumcision) are not so likely to receive it from others <hi>(peradventure more able)</hi> as from such as themselves.</p>
               <p>The former of which, if they shall appear to do, <hi>and resolve to prosecute,</hi> (the contrary whereof yet appeared those three, four, or five times that I heard them,) <hi>I shall then hold my self bound to out them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Nor the question was not; <hi>how far they miscarried in admitting a dispute with a notable corrupt disturber,</hi> who thrust in among them, and necessitated them (as they conceive) to prove by Arguments <hi>the Divinity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>f the Scriptures,</hi> which he would not grant, but most finfully denyed it: <hi>by which publique account of theirs,</hi> they say, they procured their future quiet from the disturber, and no small satisfaction to the better affected.</p>
               <p>But although this gave me some satisfaction; <hi>yet I shall desire them</hi> to give it more full and large to the satisfaction of <hi>all;</hi> and I hereby promise, that if they shall <hi>willingly</hi> admit any Disputes of that nature, not being <hi>forced thereunto</hi> (to avoyd sinful silence) I shall then hold my self engaged to out them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Nor the question was not, <hi>Whether I might let them a room for the end, and be furthering to them in the means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating of Errors,</hi> it being out of question I may not.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Nor whether I might do as much for Error, as I might do for Truth;</hi> seeing I may do nothing for Error, but all for Truth.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:41090:3"/>
               <p>But the question being at the first, <hi>as is above set forth,</hi> I prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and presented an Answer in writing <hi>in substance,</hi> as followeth in <hi>page</hi> 7. wherein I conceive is abundantly proved, that we <hi>not only may,</hi> but <hi>ought</hi> to <hi>receive, own, encourage, commend,</hi> and <hi>praise God for;</hi> and sure then may give Toleration, or let an house for money unto <hi>such persons</hi> or societies whose judgment and practise <hi>are in the main answerable to the Fundamentals of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith and Practise:</hi> Although erronious in part, both in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Discipline, both in Judgment and Practise.</p>
               <p>But after some debate upon some particulars, concerning <hi>owning; receiving,</hi> and <hi>countenancing Christians,</hi> erring both in <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> we at the last arrived at <hi>this Issue;</hi> and this was given in by my greatly honoured <hi>Christian Friends</hi> for the state of the question, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether in doing as above</hi> I did not clearly do all I did <hi>in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with them</hi> for the propagation of Error, <hi>which they affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I did;</hi> for that (besides what is above expressed) <hi>say they,</hi> These men carryed all the truth <hi>they have</hi> with them, when they went out <hi>from us,</hi> (which is our glory,) and have no need to leave <hi>us</hi> and our <hi>Congregation</hi> for Truths sake, <hi>but for Errors sake,</hi> and had no need to hire a room <hi>of you</hi> for <hi>Truths sake,</hi> nor for the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Truth,</hi> which is sufficiently maintained and held out among <hi>us,</hi> but only for their Error, which occasioned them to leave our Assemblies; and <hi>consequently</hi> for <hi>that only,</hi> and to countenance and further them in <hi>that</hi> (say they) have you let them a room, <hi>what ever you intended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so indeed this action of mine being clearly of the nature of <hi>Toleration,</hi> for without my sufferance <hi>they could not come in,</hi> nor continue there.</p>
               <p>The question <hi>now is,</hi> Whether in admitting and suffering them there, I do not properly suffer, <hi>tolerate,</hi> and <hi>countenance</hi> them <hi>in the propagation of Error,</hi> (which I do, if they assert truly) <hi>from which thou O Lord deliver thy poor servant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto which I answer.</p>
               <p>First, As my much Reverend Friends have stated the question, <hi>their conclusion thereupon</hi> falls as foul upon our godly Independent Brethren <hi>(agreed by themselves to be tolerated)</hi> or any other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters, <hi>as it doth upon these;</hi> and denies <hi>all Toleration whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> But,</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:41090:3"/>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>foundation</hi> of their Argument, <hi>upon which they build, is indeed an Error (then</hi> by them propagated) as may thus appear.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If by <hi>us</hi> you mean all Christians in our <hi>English Æ²niverse,</hi> then ye say nothing, for in that sence they are of you still, <hi>and you of them,</hi> and are <hi>vertually one,</hi> though formally divided: <hi>In that sence</hi> they as well may say it of you, as you of them.</p>
               <p>But by <hi>us,</hi> I suppose ye mean <hi>us,</hi> as reformed and <hi>Presbyterian.</hi> For as <hi>unreformed</hi> ye cannot say it, <hi>ye know how much Error ye have cast out:</hi> And as <hi>reformed</hi> you and <hi>all</hi> men know, <hi>they</hi> had not <hi>all from us,</hi> rather we from them, <hi>some of our Reformation:</hi> As for <hi>Episcopacy</hi> and <hi>stinted Liturgy,</hi> and some <hi>other Errors</hi> ye know <hi>these</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> upon whom <hi>your assertion falls alike foul,</hi> cast off and <hi>damned them;</hi> and even to persecution <hi>asserted the contrary truth,</hi> before ever any of <hi>our</hi> Assemblies durst appear in it. You know <hi>these</hi> and <hi>those</hi> helped well to break the <hi>ice</hi> in <hi>England for us,</hi> and were of the <hi>forwardest;</hi> and this is as evident as the day. <hi>I'le not hold a candle to the Sun:</hi> I'le only <hi>remember you,</hi> that it's not very strange that such should a little <hi>over-do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Can our <hi>Presbyterian Reformers</hi> assert our <hi>Reformation</hi> so perfect, as that we have <hi>all</hi> truth now held, and <hi>published among us,</hi> and that <hi>sufficiently,</hi> and no error with it; In truth I am not so perswaded:</p>
               <p>But that our <hi>way is as the light that shineth more and more, &amp;c.</hi> And that we yet <hi>retain some errors,</hi> even in <hi>some particulars,</hi> wherein <hi>these Brethren</hi> differ with us.</p>
               <p n="3">3.
